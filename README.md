## Introduction
This is a code repository for the ReactJs Weather PWA. 

In this app, I have used https://openweathermap.org/api api and trending Neumorphism design, main challenge was to show the current time of the target city.

### Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
